- Tailwind CSS for styling and layout.
- ESLint configured for linting JavaScript code.
- Responsive design with hover effects on images.
- GitHub Pages deployment setup.

### 2. Install Dependencies

Navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies using npm or yarn.

```bash
cd your-repo-name
npm install
```

or

```bash
cd your-repo-name
yarn install
```

### 3. Run the Development Server

To start the development server and view the project in your browser:

```bash
npm run dev
```

or

```bash
yarn dev
```

This will launch the project on `http://localhost:3000` (or the port specified by Vite).

### 4. Lint the Code

To run ESLint on your JavaScript files:

```bash
npm run lint
```

or

```bash
yarn lint
```

## Deployment

This project can be deployed on GitHub Pages using the following steps:

### 1. Build the Project

```bash
npm run build
```

or

```bash
yarn build
```

This will generate a production-ready version of the site in the `dist/` folder.

### 2. Deploy to GitHub Pages

- Push your changes to your GitHub repository.
- Go to your repository's settings page on GitHub.
- In the "Pages" section, set the source to the `gh-pages` branch or the `/dist` folder.
- Your site will be live at `https://your-username.github.io/your-repo-name/`.

## Configuration

### `vite.config.js`

If you are deploying to a subpath on GitHub Pages, make sure to set the `base` URL in `vite.config.js`:

```javascript
import { defineConfig } from 'vite';

export default defineConfig({
  base: '/your-repo-name/', // Change this to your repository name
});
```

### ESLint Configuration

The project includes ESLint for linting JavaScript code. You can configure ESLint by modifying the `.eslintrc` file as needed.

## Files

- `index.html`: Main HTML file for the project.
- `src/style.css`: Custom styles for the project.
- `src/images/`: Folder containing images used in the project.
- `vite.config.js`: Vite configuration file.
- `.eslintrc`: ESLint configuration file.
- `package.json`: Project dependencies and scripts.

## Acknowledgements

- Tailwind CSS for styling.
- Vite for fast builds and development.
- ESLint for keeping the code clean and consistent.
